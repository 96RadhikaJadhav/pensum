## Running and debugging the application

### Environment variables
To run the application, you need to specify a database (which must exist, but may be empty) using environment variables like in this example:

```
PENSUM_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/pensum_dev
PENSUM_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=dbuser
PENSUM_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=dbpassword
```

Adjust the content of the environment variables as necessary. Supported database types are: `mysql`

### Running the application from the command line.
To run from the command line, use `mvn` and open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

### Running and debugging the application in Intellij IDEA
- Locate the Application.java class in the Project view. It is in the src folder, under the main package's root.
- Right click on the Application class
- Select "Debug 'Application.main()'" from the list

After the application has started, you can view your it at http://localhost:8080/ in your browser. 
You can now also attach break points in code for debugging purposes, by clicking next to a line number in any source file.

### Running and debugging the application in Eclipse
- Locate the Application.java class in the Package explorer. It is in `src/main/java`, under the main package.
- Right click on the file and select `Debug As` --> `Java Application`.

Do not worry if the debugger breaks at a `SilentExitException`. This is a Spring Boot feature and happens on every startup.

After the application has started, you can view your it at http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
